i am experiencing the best part of machine learning , as i have done this project of predicting the whether a patient has diabetes or not 
based on diagnostic measurements of the  PIMA indian diabetes dataset 
from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

i enjoy learning about machine learning
this is because i mix up the bottom-up approach of learning the theory with the top down approach of applying the skills  i  acquire along . 
so these are some of the logistic regression models of diabetes that i have tried to make time to time as i learnt along what was wrong , was had to be modified etc.
learning by building , doubts , and never giving up finding resources is the best way of learning.
